Brain imaging techniques within communication research have rapidly expanded in popularity in recent years, driven by an increase in access to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology and by theoretical developments within the field. In this manuscript, we present an overview of research from within communication and cognate disciplines that has leveraged insights from fMRI research to “push the envelope,” demonstrating a synergy between methodological and theoretical progress. In addition, we provide a review of fMRI technology, methodology, and theoretical considerations, focusing on recent developments in the cognitive and brain sciences that are of special relevance to communication scholars. Finally, we provide a series of practical recommendations and resources for communication scholars interested in conducting fMRI studies.
