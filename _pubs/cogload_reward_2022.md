Successful media processing requires that an individual attend to relevant information embedded among numerous competing options. Although the factors that drive individuals’ attention toward or away from a single media processing task are relatively well characterized, there is a lack of understanding regarding how the allocation of attention proceeds in the presence of multiple, concurrent tasks. In four experiments, we show that attention during media processing is contingent on features of the “primary” task, but also on features of other available tasks. Specifically, we find evidence suggesting that “secondary” tasks during media processing elicit more attention when they are more rewarding and that the attention-capturing influence of these tasks is magnified when the “primary” task is more cognitively effortful. These results provide support for recent theoretical advancements in media psychology research and point to promising future directions using models of motivated attention to predict the allocation of attentional resources across multiple concurrent media tasks.
