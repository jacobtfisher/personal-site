# Personal Website Template - Academic

This GitHub repo contains WIP code for an personal academic website. This template is based on a Jekyll version of the "Editorial" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/), but has a number of changes that make it more suitable for academic use.

## How to Use

For those unfamiliar with how Jekyll works, check out [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details,
or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/),
and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

To get started, you can fork this reposity, create a branch named `gh-pages`, and then start editing the `_config.yml` file.

## Features

- Publications can be added as `.md` files with `.yaml` frontmatter. Creates a rollup of publications, and an individual page per publication with abstract.

You can use the following custom parameters in `_config.yml`.
